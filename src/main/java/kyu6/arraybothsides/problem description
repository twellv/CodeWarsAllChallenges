You are going to be given an array of integers.
Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N.
If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

WATCH OUT: When we made an division, the result is create as integer number, like 7/2 = 3 (third element).

[ 1,2,3,4,3,2,1 ]  An array whit 7 positions, the third one means > 4.

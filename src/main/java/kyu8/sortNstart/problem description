You will be given a vector of strings. You must sort it alphabetically
(case-sensitive, and based on the ASCII values of the chars) and then return the first value.

The returned value must be a string, and have "***" between each of its letters.

You should not remove or add elements from/to the array.


OBS: can i use JOIN and SPLIP.
    String[] arr = word.split ("");
    String result = String.join("***", arr);

(REGEX) MODIFYERS:
    (?i) ignore Uper and Lower case
    (?x) Comments
    (?m) Mult Lines
    (?s) Dottal

All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish.
There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal's name.
For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.

        public void fixedTest() {
             assertTrue(Kata.feast("great blue heron","garlic nann"));
             assertTrue(Kata.feast("chickadee","chocolate cake"));
             assertFalse(Kata.feast("brown bear","bear claw"));
        }

- returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast.
- beast and dish are always lowercase strings.
- Must have at least two letters.
- beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string.

Codigo alheio:

public static boolean feast(String beast, String dish) {

    return beast.charAt(0)==dish.charAt(0) && beast.charAt(beast.length()-1) == dish.charAt(dish.length()-1);

}
